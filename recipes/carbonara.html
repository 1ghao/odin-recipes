    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Carbonara is one of Italy's most famous dishes, and it's definitely La
      Lazio's regional dish. A dish renowned for its taste, its history and more
      importantly, in my opinion, its simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the easiests dish to make, requiring only 15 minutes of
      cooking if you are familiar with the recipe, which you will sure be
      because you won't be able to stop making it after you learn how to do it.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        100gr of pasta per person (normally spaguetti or linguine but anything
        works).
      </li>
      <li>
        Two egg yolks per person or alternatively you can use one entire egg
        (Italians pardon me).
      </li>
      <li>Guanciale (pancetta or bacon will "work").</li>
      <li>Grating of pecorino cheese</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil some water in a pot.</li>
      <li>
        When the water is boiled, add salt into it (the water should taste like
        seawater so be generous).
      </li>
      <li>Add the pasta into the boiled water.</li>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta till
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_dente"> al dente</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, chop the guanciale in cubes and cook it in a pan till
        golden (bear in mind that guanciale is so fatty that it doesn't need any
        oil).
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the sauce by adding in a bowl the egg yolks, black pepper (the
        dish is called carbonara because it looks like it has minces of carbon
        so don't cut on the black pepper) and grated cheese, then mix it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix everything together and serve it with more grated pecorino, enjoy
        your dish!
      </li>
    </ol>
