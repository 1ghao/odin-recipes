    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Shakshuka is a traditional north african breakfast (although I thought it
      was turkish). It is very delicious and even though you are going to spend
      a good amount of time chopping the ingredients if you are as unsharp as me
      at doing it, you are going be grateful for it.
